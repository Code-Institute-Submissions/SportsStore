## Description

This application is designed to allow for Andrew O Brien Sports Massage & Supplies to advertise and sell his products via the online E-commerce store.
The application gives a direct implication that it is sports orientated from the home image and features responsive designs throughout. 
Dropdown menus indicate available categories to filter products on or optionally a user can choose to view all products and use the search bar within the products section for key words.
The challenge I undertook was to build an ecommerce site for a friend, manage his requirements throughout the process of the build while also trying to improve my skillset as a developer.


## UX

The site has been designed mainly using client feedback. The client outlined that his favourite colour was orange and I took that and integrated it into the design of the website - while not going for the 
brashness of orange, salmon was chosen as a worthy replacement. 
The user is greeted by an incredible HD photograph or sports ground and instantly prompted to look for an appointment or to go view products on the E-commerce site.
Once within the products section users can filter based on category from a convenient drop down menu or use the search option for key words within the name or description of the product. 
The user can then choose to add the item to their card, go to checkout or go back to products from this page. 
Once the user goes to checkout they will be able to remove any item from their cart which also resets the price of their grand total and cart balance. 
The site is linked directly with stripe and uses webhooks for intelligent error management.

## Deployment

GitHub was used to develop the project, store code in the repository and maintain the version control of this project. 
The live demo has been deployed using Heroku and all versions pushed to the master branch on github are automatically deployed the Heroku Master.

The following steps were used to deploy the Wexford Slang Dictionary on Heroku:

1. Created an App Name
2. Logged into Heroku using $ heroku login creating a connection between Github and the Heroku application
3. Checked Heroku Apps to make sure my project was available
4. Created a new Git repository using git init
5. Added my files to the repositary and associated my Heroku application as my master branch(remote master branch)
6. Created my requirements.txt file
7. Created my ProcFile
8. Followed the steps on Boutique_ado to create an AWS S3 Bucket, seems inconsistent - difficult to get working & didn't get feedback from Tutor support.
9. Add my config Vars: SECRET_KEY, DATABASE_URL, STRIPE KEYS, AWS KEYS
10. Added both files to github and pushed to Heroku Master
11. Ran my application using $ heroku ps:scale web=1 to scale dynos
12. Logged into Heroku and set up the Config Variables in the settings > config variables section (IP & PORT)
13. Application Deployed
14. The link generated can be used instantly. The link generated for this site as: https://wexforddictionaryproject.herokuapp.com/
15. I connected my Heroku App to github to automatically deploy from the master branch, I managed the build through github then would test the app through heroku every few commits/pushes. 


N.B. my application was failing in Heroku due to an error in my requirements.txt file not finding module 'storages'. Troubleshooted many issues using the Heroku logs functionality which was very useful in locating the error.
